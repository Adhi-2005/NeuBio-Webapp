Role

Act as an Expert React & Tailwind CSS Developer.

Context

We currently have a web app designed for a "Gen 2" Bluetooth hearing aid. However, the Gen 2 hardware is not yet released. We need to pivot the application to focus on a "Hearing Journal" for existing "Gen 1" users (who use a non-electronic implant with an external processor).

Task

Refactor the existing application to prioritize the "Hearing Journal" features described below. The existing "Gen 2" features (Bluetooth, battery, frequency modes) must be moved to a secondary view and marked as "Coming Soon" or disabled.

Global State & Navigation

Authentication Flow:

Register: Fields: First Name, Second Name, Email, Password, Retype Password.

New Optional Field: Guardian Name, Guardian Phone Number.

Login: Email and Password.

Forgot Password: Link to enter email -> simulates sending a reset link.

Onboarding (Post-Registration):

Ask: "Do you currently use our Product?" (Yes / Want to use).

If Yes:

Input 1: Date of Implant Surgery.

Input 2: Date of Activation (The day they switched on the Gen 1 processor and started hearing).

Main Navigation:

Home/Journal (Default): The new features described below.

Device/Gen 2: The old features (Bluetooth/Battery). This page should be accessible but show a "Gen 2 Hardware Coming Soon" overlay or state, preventing interaction with the controls.

Feature: Hearing Journal (The Dashboard)

This is the main landing page after login.

1. The "Hearing Age" Counter:

Display a prominent circular visual at the top.

Logic: Calculate (Current Date - Date of Activation).

Display: "Day X of your Hearing Journey" (e.g., "Day 35").

2. The Milestone Calendar:

Display a calendar component below the counter.

Visual Markers: Automatically mark the "Date of Surgery" and "Date of Activation" on the calendar.

Appointments: Users can click a button "Register Appointment".

Opens a Modal/Dialog.

Fields: Date of Visit, Doctor Name/Notes.

Upload: "Upload Audiogram" (Image upload).

UI Feedback: If an image is uploaded, show a success message: "Audiogram uploaded for AI Refinement."

Once submitted, mark this appointment date on the calendar.

3. Survey Section:

Below the calendar, display a grid of "cards" or "boxes".

These are links to external surveys (e.g., "Month 1 Feedback", "Device Comfort Survey").

4. Suggestions & Tips:

At the bottom, show a "Daily Tips" or "Care Suggestions" section.

Example content: "Measures to take at the beginning of your hearing journey," "How to clean your processor," etc.

Technical Requirements

Use React for the framework.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling (make it look clean, medical, and trustworthy).

Use Lucide-React for icons (Calendar, Upload, User, Heart).

Mock the backend calls (console.log data) but structure the forms to handle real data types.

Ensure the design is mobile-responsive.

Summary of Change

Move the current "Gen 2" dashboard to a /device route and lock it. Build the /journal route as the new Home. Implement the auth flow and onboarding data collection (dates) as prerequisites to entering the Journal.
